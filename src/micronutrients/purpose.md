It is a powerful antioxidant that helps maintain healthy skin, mucous membranes, and the linings of the respiratory, digestive, and urinary tracts. A deficiency can lead to night blindness, weakened immunity, and skin issues. Excessive intake may lead to hypervitaminosis A, causing symptoms like nausea, dizziness, and in severe cases, liver damage.

#### Vitamin D
Vitamin D is crucial for calcium absorption and bone health. It also supports the immune system, muscle function, and cell growth. Deficiency can lead to rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, causing bone pain and muscle weakness. High levels of vitamin D can lead to toxicity, resulting in symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and weakness.

#### Vitamin E
Acts as a potent antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals. It supports the immune system and helps maintain healthy skin and eyes. Vitamin E deficiency is rare but can lead to nerve and muscle damage. High doses can interfere with blood clotting, so it's important not to exceed recommended levels.

#### Vitamin K
Essential for blood clotting, as it helps produce proteins necessary for this process. It also supports bone health and helps prevent excessive bleeding. Deficiency can lead to bleeding disorders, while excess vitamin K intake is generally well-tolerated, as the body excretes excess amounts.
- **Vitamin K1 (Phylloquinone):** This form is primarily found in leafy green vegetables, providing a significant source of vitamin K in the diet. It plays a key role in blood clotting and is essential for preventing excessive bleeding.
- **Vitamin K2 (Menaquinones):** This form of vitamin K is found in animal products and fermented foods. It is also synthesized by gut bacteria. Vitamin K2 is important for bone health and helps direct calcium to the bones, contributing to skeletal strength.
A deficiency in vitamin K can lead to bleeding disorders, as the blood's ability to clot is compromised. However, excessive intake of vitamin K is generally well-tolerated, as the body efficiently excretes excess amounts. Maintaining an adequate level of vitamin K through a balanced diet is crucial for overall health and proper blood coagulation.

Why are there missing B vitamins? What happened to B4, B8, B9, B10 and B11?

They were initially believed to be distinct vitamins, but further research found that they were either not essential for humans, not distinct from other vitamins, or not required in the diet under normal circumstances. Thus, they were either reclassified or combined with other vitamins. For example, B4 is just adenine, one of the nucleobases in DNA and RNA. B8 is just inositol, a type of sugar alcohol. B10 and B11 were merged into B9, etc.

#### Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)
Involved in energy metabolism, helping convert food into usable energy for the body. It is crucial for nerve function. Thiamine deficiency, known as beriberi, can lead to symptoms like fatigue, muscle weakness, and nerve damage.

#### Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)
Essential for energy production and the metabolism of fats, drugs, and steroids. It also supports healthy skin, eyes, and nerve function. Riboflavin deficiency can lead to sore throat, redness and swelling of the lining of the mouth and throat, cracks or sores on the outsides of the lips, and at the corners of the mouth.

#### Vitamin B3 (Niacin)
Supports energy metabolism and helps maintain healthy skin, nerves, and digestion. Deficiency of niacin leads to pellagra, characterized by diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia.

#### Vitamin B9 (Folic Acid)
Crucial for DNA synthesis, making it important for growth and development. Essential for pregnant women to prevent neural tube defects in the developing fetus. Folate deficiency can lead to anemia and impair the body's ability to repair DNA.

#### Vitamin B6
Involved in over 100 enzyme reactions in the body, including those for metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis. Deficiency can lead to symptoms like anemia, dermatitis, and seizures.

#### Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid)
Integral in energy metabolism, playing a role in the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Pantothenic acid deficiency is rare and typically only occurs in severe malnutrition.

#### Vitamin B12
Necessary for the formation of red blood cells, DNA synthesis, and nerve function. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to anemia, neurological issues, and fatigue.

#### Vitamin B7 (Biotin)
Aids in the metabolism of fatty acids, amino acids, and glucose. Important for healthy skin and nails. Biotin deficiency is rare and usually only occurs in individuals with specific genetic mutations or those who consume raw egg whites in large amounts.

#### Vitamin C 
Acts as an antioxidant, supports immune function, and is crucial for collagen production, which aids in wound healing. Vitamin C deficiency can lead to scurvy, characterized by fatigue, swollen gums, and skin issues.

#### Magnesium 
Involved in over 300 biochemical reactions in the body, including muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, and blood pressure regulation. Magnesium deficiency can lead to muscle cramps, heart palpitations, and anxiety. Excessive intake can lead to diarrhea.

#### Calcium 
Calcium is essential for the formation and maintenance of strong bones and teeth. It also plays a crucial role in muscle function, nerve signaling, and blood clotting. Additionally, calcium is involved in various enzymatic reactions and helps regulate hormone secretion. Calcium deficiency can lead to weakened bones (osteoporosis) and muscle cramps.

#### Phosphorus 
Essential for the formation of DNA, RNA, and ATP, a molecule that carries energy within cells. It also plays a crucial role in bone and teeth formation. Phosphorus deficiency is rare but can lead to weakness and bone pain. Excessive intake may disrupt calcium balance.

#### Sodium 
Critical for maintaining fluid balance, transmitting nerve impulses, and supporting muscle function. It also plays a role in regulating blood pressure. Sodium deficiency (hyponatremia) can lead to symptoms like headache and confusion. Excessive intake may contribute to high blood pressure.

#### Potassium (Kalium) 
Potassium is crucial for maintaining proper muscle function, including the heart. It helps regulate blood pressure, supports nerve function, and is involved in fluid balance within cells. Potassium deficiency can lead to muscle weakness, fatigue, and irregular heartbeats.

#### Chloride 
Works alongside sodium to help maintain fluid balance and regulate pH levels in the body. It is also a component of stomach acid, aiding in digestion. Chloride deficiency is rare and usually occurs in conjunction with sodium loss. Excessive intake can lead to high blood pressure.
