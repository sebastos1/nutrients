What are antioxidants?

Antioxidants are molecules that protect our cells from damage caused by free radicals. Free radicals are highly reactive molecules with unpaired electrons, which can cause harm to cellular structures and DNA. Antioxidants neutralize these harmful free radicals by donating electrons without becoming unstable themselves. They play a crucial role in maintaining cellular health and are found in various natural sources like fruits, vegetables, and whole foods. Consuming a diet rich in antioxidants helps counteract oxidative stress, which is associated with a range of health issues including aging, cancer, and chronic diseases.

### Fat-soluble
---

#### Vitamin A
- Antioxidant
- Maintains eyesight, prevents night blindness
- Helps with fat storage
- Protects against colds, flu, some infection (immune function)
- Maintains healthy skin, mucous membranes, respiratory linings, and digestive and urinary tracts
- Also needed to grow new cells, lower cholesterol, and reduce risk of heart disease and stroke.

Comes as "preforms" as retinol or retynyl ester, or "proforms" as cartenoids.

Deficiancy can lead to night blindnesss, lower immunity, and skin issues.
Excessive intake may lead to hypervitaminosis A, causing nausea, dizziness, and potentially liver damage. Tolerable upper limit is around 3000μg.

| | Dose |
|-|-|
| Men | 900μg |
| Women | 700μg |

| Women | 15mg |

Average intake is a lot lower than RDI, but due to the dangers of elevated E, it's suggested to only supplement with 15-35mg. Obtainable from fat-rich foods, with a lot being in cold-pressed plaint oils, nuts, seeds, and avocados. Zinc is also needed to maintain proper vitamin E levels.

#### Vitamin K
- Essential for blood clotting (needed to produce prothrombin)
- Supports bone health
- Converts glucose into glycogen for storing
- Proteins in vascular smooth muscle, cartilage and bone are dependent on vitamin K.

The seemingly random K is short for Koagulationsvitamin, meaning coagulation vitamin.

Deficiency can lead to bleeding disorders, and might contribute to osteoporosis.
Excessive intake is generally well-tolerated, as the body efficiently excretes excess amounts.

| | Dose |
|-|-|
| Men | 120μg |
| Women | 90μg |
| Mean intake | 125μg |

- **Vitamin K1 (Phylloquinone):** This form is primarily found in leafy green vegetables, providing a significant source of vitamin K in the diet. It plays a key role in blood clotting and is essential for preventing excessive bleeding.
- **Vitamin K2 (Menaquinones):** This form of vitamin K is found in animal products and fermented foods. It is also synthesized by gut bacteria. Vitamin K2 is important for bone health and helps direct calcium to the bones, contributing to skeletal strength.

### Water-soluble
---
Why are there missing B vitamins? What happened to B4, B8, B9, B10 and B11?

They were initially believed to be distinct vitamins, but further research found that they were either not essential for humans, not distinct from other vitamins, or not required in the diet under normal circumstances. Thus, they were either reclassified or combined with other vitamins. For example, B4 is just adenine, one of the nucleobases in DNA and RNA. B8 is just inositol, a type of sugar alcohol. B10 and B11 were merged into B9, etc.

Water-soluble vitamins can't be overdosed - they are excreted in urine.

## Minerals
---

What are electrolytes?

Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that play vital roles in maintaining fluid balance, nerve function, and muscle contractions in the body. They are essential for various physiological processes, including hydration, nerve signaling, and muscle function. Electrolytes are lost through activities like sweating and need to be replenished through diet or supplements to ensure proper bodily functions.

### Macro-minerals
---

#### Calcium
- Supports muscle function
- Transmits nerve impulses
- Involved in certain hormone releases
- Important in formation of strong bones and teeth
- Involved in blood clotting

Now, since 99% of our body's calcium is in our bones, we can just draw from there if we aren't getting enough through our diet, right? No. Deficiency can and will lead to osteoporosis, and muscle cramps.

| | Dose |
|-|-|
| Men | 1g |
| Women | 1g |
| Mean intake | 0.75-1.25g |

Obtainable from yogurt, whey protein supplements, milk, cottage cheese and dark leafy greens. Calcium supplementation can prevent the body from absorbing other minerals and vitamnis, so usually a person shouldn't take any supplements containing calcium.


#### Magnesium
- Used in 300+ biochemical reactions
- Used in protein synthesis!
- Involved in muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, blood pressure regulation, DNA synthesis, energy production, and bone formation

Deficiency is rare because we have a lot of magnesium stores, but it can lead to weak muscle contraction, fatigue, disruptions in mineral stability, heart irrythmia and even personality changes (like anxiety). Alcholics and type 2 diabetics and similar are at higher risk of deficiency.
Excessive intake can lead to diarrhea.

| | Dose |
|-|-|
| Men | 420mg |
| Women | 310mg |
| Mean intake | 250mg |

#### Phosphorus 
- Important part of ATP, the cell's energy carrier
- Essential for formation of DNA and RNA
- Used in tissue growth

Phosphorus is regularly lost in sweat and urine - our goal is to replenish what we lose. Deficiency is rare due to stores, but can lead to weakness and bone pain.
Excessive intake may disrupt calcium balance.

| | Dose |
|-|-|
| Men | 700mg |
| Women | 700mg |
| Mean intake | 1250mg |

Foods rich in protein tend to also be rich in phosphorus - meat, poultry and fish. Wheat, potatoes and peanuts are also good sources.

#### Potassium (Kalium) 
- Electrolyte
- Used for transferring nutrients through cell membranes
- Helps break down carbs

Potassium can also be lost through sweat, which can lead to muscle cramping. Deficiency can also lead to fatigue, weakness, and irregular heartbeats. Hypokalemia can be life-threatening!

| | Dose |
|-|-|
| Men | 5g |
| Women | 5g |
| Mean intake | 3g |

Excessive intake may contribute to high blood pressure.

| | Dose |
|-|-|
| Men | 2.3g |
| Women | 2.3g |
| Mean intake | enough |

Most people get enough sodium in their diet, but it's most readily obtainable through regular table salt (40% sodium).

"Now, the daily salt recommendation for sedentary people is about 2.3-grams of salt per day. If you’re an athlete or bodybuilder, ignore that completely. Com-plete-ly. Liberally salt your food, eat salty snacks like peanuts or beef jerky, and don’t be afraid to cook meats in high-sodium marinades or sauces. Salt is incredibly important to maintaining both strength and endurance performance so ensure you’re taking in higher levels of salt as an athlete."

#### Chloride
- Electrolyte
- Works with sodium to maintain fluid balance and help transmit electrical impulses in nerves
- Essential component of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, aiding digestion
- Involved in regulating pH levels in the body

Deficiency can lead to muscle weakness and fatigue, nausea, and hypertension in severe cases.
Excessive intake can lead to excessive thirst, high blood pressure, and fluid retention.

| | Dose |
|-|-|
| Men | 2.3g |
| Women | 2.3g |

Chloride is readily obtained from table salt (sodium chloride), as well as from foods like tomatoes, lettuce, celery, and seaweed. While most people easily meet their chloride needs through a balanced diet, athletes who engage in intense physical activity and sweat heavily may require higher intakes to compensate for losses during exercise.

### Trace-minerals
